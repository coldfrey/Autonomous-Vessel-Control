\initial{T}he following paper explores the application pf reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in autonomously controlling a kite-powered vessel. This novel approach is grounded in the growing need for sustainable maritime transportation technologies that can mitigate the environmental impact associated with traditional fuel-powered propulsion systems. The research focuses on developing a sophisticated simulation environment for training an RL agent. Utilizing the MLAgents toolkit, Unity Game Engine, Python, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, the project meticulously constructs a virtual marine environment alongside realistic models of a boat and a kite. The simulation is then used to train an RL agent to autonomously control the boat and kite with the aim of autonomously navigating a predefined course. The project successfully demonstrates the ability of an RL agent to learn the task of autonomously controlling a kite-powered vessel, however limitations in the simulation environment and the RL implementation prevent the agent from learning complex autonomous navigation. Future work should focus on improving the complexity of the simulation and the configuration of the RL, while continuing to think about the real world implementation and deployment of this system.

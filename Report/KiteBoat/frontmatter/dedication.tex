\chapter*{Dedication and Acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
This journey of exploration and learning would not have been possible without the support and inspiration from some remarkable individuals to whom I owe my deepest gratitude.

First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt thanks to Jack Lippold, whose enthusiasm for coding ignited my passion in this field. 

I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to James, the coffee man from Rolling Italy, who produces by far the best coffee on campus and can be found outside Senate House. James, your coffee has been the fuel that powered me through the countless hours of study and work. Thank you for being an integral part of my academic journey.

To my family, especially my parents and brother, your unwavering support, understanding, patience and encouragement have been the driving force behind my efforts.

Lastly, I'd like to thank my supervisor, Andrew Calway, for his guidance and support throughout this project.

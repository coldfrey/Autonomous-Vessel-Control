\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:intro}

\initial{T}his chapter delves into the application of machine learning in sailboat control, with a particular emphasis on utilizing kites as a means of propulsion. The exploration of kite-powered vessel technologies presents a novel avenue to enhance the efficiency of sailboats, transcending the limitations inherent in traditional sail systems. The fusion of machine learning, specifically Reinforcement Learning (RL), with kite propulsion systems, opens up a realm of possibilities for autonomous sailboat control, optimizing the harnessing of wind power in a dynamic and adaptive manner. Through a meticulous review of existing technologies, RL principles, and related work in this domain, this chapter aims to lay a solid foundation for the ensuing discussion on the proposed RL approach to optimizing the autonomous control of kite-powered boats. 



The subsequent sections will provide an in-depth examination of kite-powered vessel technologies, introduce the core concepts of RL, discuss relevant literature, identify gaps in current research, and highlight the novelty and potential contributions of the proposed work.
